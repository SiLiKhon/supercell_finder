# Supercell Finder

### Overview
Supercell finder (`supercell_finder`) is a tool designed to efficiently determine a minimal crystal supercell that can enclose a sphere of a specified diameter. It is based on a heuristic approach, and, while global minimality is not guaranteed, the results should be significantly better compared to simple diagonal scaling of the original cell.
